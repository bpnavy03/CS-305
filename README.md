Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
-Artemis Financial is a consulting company that develops individualized financial plans for its customers, ranging from savings, retirement, investments, and insurance accounts. To modernize its operations, Artemis Financial aims to use the most current and effective software security. Since their organization deals with large sums of financial information, security is a high priority for them and their customers. Protection and privacy are critical for this organization to protect its customers, their assets, and the company's reputation. As a financial institution, Artemis Financial is the target of a wide range of potential attacks, such as denial of service (DoS) to data breaches.

What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?
-I believe that I refactored and identified vulnerabilities well, and gave them good advice to help elimnate these vulnerabilities. Secure coding is important to protect against malicious intent. Software security protects not only the customer, but their customers as well. It protects all parties involved by mitigating data exposure and compromise.

What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
-The most challenging aspect of the vulnerability assessment was determining false positives. I had to read a lot to figure that out.

How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
-I increased layers of security by including sanitizing user inputs and identifying vulnerabilities and providing responses to those vulnerabilities. Integration with virus and malware protection, coupled with a firewall, would be helpful for the future.

How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
-I read and reread the code several times to ensure it was secure. Sanitizing user inputs helps prevent against DoS attacks and character injection attacks. I did look to see if I introduced new vulnerabilities but did not find any.

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
-I comment a lot in my code. It helps me think, and undo unwanted mistakes. I believe this is a good coding practice for software engineers and programmers. Using other resources to help identify mistakes, especially compiling errors, is also useful.

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
-Possibly examples of secure, sound coding practices with an ability to identify and elimnate vulnerabilities.
